Personal Best Manager for a single person (no logins)
This is my first "full" project with react meteor (and a little bit of d3).
As there is no user registration, everything you do, will be visible for everyone else.

You can add sports or other activities.
Then you add scores to the selected sport.
Much of the icons (from flaticons.net, thanks) should be self-explanatory, some probably are not.

The difficulty of the app was to get some sort of generic score where time, length, points, weights, things as 1-1 or 7-6 (12-10) 6-0 could be handled generically.

The next problem was entering those scores, specifically durations. momentjs was very valuable here.

The app is no longer live.

Have fun.
